            <p>
                A core component of battles in FGO is Artificial Intelligence (AI). There are two types, Svt and Field
                AIs. They control events ranging from debuffs at the start of a quest to enemies using a skill with
                ignore invincible right before using their noble phantasm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Svt AI is an AI pertaining to a single enemy. Skills and attack listed in this Svt AI will be done by
                its corresponding enemy. If the quest has multiple enemies, each one will have its own Svt AI. When you
                break a bar, the follow-up enemy is not considered the same, it will have its own Svt AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                Field AI is an AI pertaining to the ‚Äúfield‚Äù or ‚Äúsettings‚Äù of the quest. Furthermore, each quest may have
                multiple field AIs or none. Field AIs are usually used to apply buffs to player servants or enemies. The
                actions in these Field AIs will never be direct attacks, but they can still be damaging such as{" "}

            <p>Below is an example of a typical AI with all the attributes listed.</p>

            <p>
                The AIs are divided into parent AIs and sub (children) AIs. In the{" "}
                <a href="#ai-basic-example">example</a> above, <b>AI 94035323</b> is the parent AI and the two sub AIs
                are <b>2</b> and <b>1</b>. If there are multiple sub AIs, one of them will be picked to be executed.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, <a href="#ai-condition">conditions</a> are checked and only sub AIs with satisfied conditions are
                legible to be executed. Then, <a href="#ai-priority-weight">priorities and weights</a> are checked. The
                sub AIs with the highest priority and satisifed conditions will be executed. If there are multiple
                eligible sub AIs with the same priority, one will be picked randomly using the weights specified. After
                one sub AI is selected, the action listed in the sub AI will be executed. Details about the selection
                criteria and action taken will be described in later sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the AI and sub AI are processed, if <a href="#ai-next">Next AI</a> is specified, it will move on
                to the next parent AI. If the next parent AI also has multiple sub AIs, the selection procedure will
                occur again with the new sub AIs. If Next AI is not specified, the same parent AI will be executed again
                and the selection procedure is run again.

    const nextAi = (
        <>
            Once the action in the sub AI has been completed, it will go to the next parent AI which can be found here.
            In some cases, the Next AI section can be empty, this means the parent AI will stay unchanged. The process
            will then continue until the enemy runs out of actions or is out of target.

    const graph = (
        <>
            <p>
                The artificial intelligence, or the sequence of attacks and skills, can be represented by a graph like
                at the top of AI pages. The graph is made out of nodes (rectangles with numbers in them) and edges (the
                lines connecting them). The nodes with bold text represent the parent AIs while the others are their sub
                AIs. The parent nodes are connected to their children with solid arrows. If the sub AI's Next AI is not
                specified, it won't have an arrow coming out of it. Otherwise, it will have a dotted arrow pointing
                towards the next parent AI.{" "}

                            and processed, the game will then repeat the process and pick one of the <code>105220</code>{" "}
                            sub AIs again since these three sub AIs do not have Next AI specified.

                    execute. Again, the game will stay at <code>105221</code> if one of the first three sub AIs is
                    chosen or move to <code>105222</code> if <code>105221-4</code> is chosen.

                <li>
                    The same process will happen again in <code>105222</code>.

                <li>
                    If the game arrives at parent AI <code>105223</code>, since all <code>105223</code>'s sub AI don't

        </>
    );

    const actNum = (
        <>
            Act Num is an identifier to when the AI is used. For example, sub AIs with Act Num <code>Anytime</code> can
            happen anytime. <code>Anytime</code> is usually used for regular attacks and skills. Below is some other
            common Act Nums:
            <ul className="my-2">
                <li>
                    <code>Reaction Enemyturn Start:</code> The beginning of enemy turn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>Reaction Enemyturn End:</code> The end of enemy turn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>Reaction Wavestart:</code> The beginning of the wave.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>Shift Sarvant After:</code> After a bar breaks ("Sarvant" is a typo in the game code).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>Max Np:</code> Right before the enemy uses its noble phantasm to use certain skills like
                    ignore invincible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While sub AIs with Act Num <code>Anytime</code> do consume one enemy action, all of the Act Num
                mentioned in the list above do not cosume one when executed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, skill seal cannot block skills executed by aforementioned Act Num such as break bar skills. If
                the sub AI has act type <code>Skill Id</code>, the skill will still be executed even if the actor was
                skill sealed. However, these "unavoidable skills" are sometime purposefully allowed to be blocked using
                other sub AIs. For example, this is the case with
                <Link to={`/${region}/quest/94048701/1`}> Raging Billows! Kakare Shibata!</Link> or{" "}
                <Link to={`/${region}/quest/94041306/1`}>Sweets Universe</Link>.
            </p>
            <img alt="Ai Shibata" src={ai_shibata} width="100%" className="mb-2" />
            <p>
                Since Sub ID 2, 3 and 4 have higher priorities, if Shibata is petrified or skill sealed, he won't use
                the "‚Ä¶Advance!" skill.
            </p>
        </>
    );

    const condition = (
        <>
            Condition is a prerequisite factor that needs to be true in order for the sub AI to be eligible. A common
            example of conditions can be seen with defensive skills such as evade or guts which typically require that
            the enemy be under a certain HP threshold to be used. While there are many different possible conditions,
            most are self explanatory and the same ones reoccur often. Here are some common conditions:
            <ul className="mt-1">
                <li>
                    <code>None:</code> There is no prerequisite condition.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>Turn: &#123;ùë•&#125;:</code> The turn has to be ùë•.

                This represents the order in which the sub AIs are considered and the weights if there are multiple sub

            </p>

                For example, considering the sub AIs with the following priorities and weights:{" "}

                    priority of 100.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the first sub AI's condition is not satisfied, the sub AIs with the second highest priority are
                    considered: <code>50|60, 50|40, 50|30</code>.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    If none of the 100 and 50 priority sub AIs' conditions are satisfied, the <code>1|100</code> sub AI
                    condition is checked and will be executed if possible.
